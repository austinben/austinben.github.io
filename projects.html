                analyze thermal efficiency of building surfaces! this tools allows users to upload thermal images captured by flir cameras,
                select regions of interest, enter some environmental data, and receive a detailed report about several different aspects 
                related the thermal data obtained from the images.

            <p>
                as part of our security class, we were tasked with creating a shell script that displays
                some useful information on a given ip address, url, domain, or email address, with the idea that 
                it would provide quick insight during response to a given security incident or event. this script produces
                a concise and informative output containing information such as txt records,
                domain information, name servers, mx records, etc.

                in my distributed systems class, our team was challenged with proposing innovative
                solutions using distributed systems while simultaneously preserving
                the privacy of sensitive generational knowledge.

                for an embedded systems project, our team was tasked with researching, implementing, and 
                optimizing a 128-bit implementation of the rsa cryptography algorithm on a 32-bit arm processor
                using a variety of optimization techniques and a proposed hardware assist.
